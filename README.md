# Icinga2 Freshdesk Connector
#### By Andrew Jaffie (ajaffie)

## Description
This script is intended to be used to provide an interface between Icinga and a Freshdesk helpdesk. You can create a NotificationCommand object in your Icinga configuration to call this script so that when a server goes down, a ticket will be created in the helpdesk so that you can track how often issues occur in addition to the notification itself. 

## Requirements
Internet access, python 3, and the python requests library are required. Installation instructions below.
